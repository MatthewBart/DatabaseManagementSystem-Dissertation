"# DatabaseManagementSystem-Dissertation" 

The purpose of this README is to illsutrate the basic functions and how to compile this project.
The project must be imported to Visual Studio and can run as long as all files are present and you're located in the main.cpp file. Simply pull from git and you should
have no issue running it.

The project is a simplistic Database Management System that takes in commands, stores them in a B-Tree for manipulating which is then stored in a text file.
Once loaded you can type help to print all commands as well as what parameters are required. This project is built on the idea that you are inputting an integer key and any other type of value.

The DBMS can create and delete files and once the 'use" command is used then you can access all elements in the file.
When using the file you can insert, remove, update and display all keys and values stored in the database file. After every command the tree is stored to file so data loss does not occur.

A screen cast is included in the file which showcases the use of all the commands.
